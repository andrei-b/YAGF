YAGF is a graphical front-end for cuneiform OCR tool.
With YAGF you can open already scanned image files or obtain new images via XSane (scanning results are automatically passed to YAGF).
Once you have a scanned image you can prepare it for recognition, select particular image areas for recognition, set the recognition language and so no.
Recognized text is displayed in a editor window where it can be corrected, saved to disk or copied to clipboard.  
YAGF also provides some facilities for a multi-page recognition (see the online help for more details).
