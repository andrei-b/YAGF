YAGF is a graphical front-end for cuneiform and tesseract OCR tools.
With YAGF you can open already scanned image files or obtain new images via XSane (scanning results are automatically passed to YAGF).
Once you have a scanned image you can prepare it for recognition, select particular image areas for recognition, set the recognition language and so no.
Recognized text is displayed in a editor window where it can be corrected, saved to disk or copied to clipboard.  
YAGF also provides some facilities for a multi-page recognition (see the online help for more details).

Building YAGF requires:
  qt4 development tools version > 4.5
  libaspell development package
Running YAGF requires:
  Qt 4.5 or later, aspell
Of course it is desirable to have xsane installed.
PDFimport is done using either pdftoppm or gs utilities. Make sure at least one of these is installed if you are going to recognize text from PDFs.
