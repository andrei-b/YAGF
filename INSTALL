These are generic installation instructions.

You will need CMake to build YAGF from sources.
There are two modes for building YAGF with CMake: in-source and out-source.
The out-source mode is preferred. To build YAGF in this mode follow these instructions:
make a directory for your build (for example yagf-build). Assuming your yagf-build directory is in the same directory as the yagf directory you can command:

cd yagf-build
cmake ../yagf
make
sudo make install

You can now remove the yagf-build directory.

In order to perform an in-source build you should issue this simple set of commands:

cd yagf
cmake ./
make
sudo make install
